/**
@mainpage The library for the AberLED shield. Please see the AberLEDClass for more details.

\section author Authors
This a modified version of the AberLED library by Jim Finnis. David Hunter added code to drive
a Pulse Width Modulated LED dimming functionality plus a few useful functions.

The original library can be found at 

http://users.aber.ac.uk/jcf1/index.php/cs120

\section intro Introduction
This library should come as a zip file, which you should import into
your Arduino IDE using the library import tool (Sketch menu/Import Library../
Add Library..). Once imported it can be added to projects.

Including the AberLED.h file will create an object called `AberLED` 
of the class AberLEDClass. To use it, all the function names described
under AberLEDClass should be prefixed with `AberLED.` 

Here's a minimal example:
\code{.cpp}
#include <AberLED.h>

void setup(){
    AberLED.begin();
    Serial.begin(9600);
}   

bool b[]={false,false,false,false,false};

void loop(){
    AberLED.clear();
    delay(1);
    for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
        if(AberLED.getButton(i+1))
            b[i] = !b[i];
    }
    for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
        if(b[i])
            AberLED.set(i,1,RED);
        AberLED.set(i,2,GREEN);
    }
    AberLED.set(0,0,YELLOW);
    
    AberLED.swap();
    Serial.println(AberLED.getTicks());
}       

\endcode

\section old Old boards
If you have an old beige board, call 
\code{.cpp}
AberLED.setRevision(REV00);
\endcode
in your setup, immediately after AberLED.begin().
